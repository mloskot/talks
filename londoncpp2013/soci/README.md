# SOCI

Introduction to [SOCI](http://soci.sourceforge.net) - 
The C++ database access library.

Slides from talk given at London C++ Meeting on 28 May, 2013 at Google Campus
in London as part of [C++ User Group London](http://meetingcpp.com/).

Slides were originally created using the fantastic http://slid.es service
and Hakim's awesome [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/),
then exported into standalone HTML file.
